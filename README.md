# tick-tack-toe-123
My first game I have ever made and my first project I've updated to GitHub

This compiles well with Microsoft Visual C++ 2003. I haven't tested on any newer compiler. 
It uses a 2D game engine called Haaf's Game Engine (HGE), which allows easy code management, and fast rendering.

When playing game, use keys UP-Down-Left-Right to move the map.

I am new to GitHub, so if there's anything please download my working project here and compile it :

About the game data, please download it here :

The compiler might generate a lot of warnings, it's fine that way to ensure its more accurate rendering

If the library files for HGE are outdated, please visit the HGE forum to get the lastest ones

It's incomplete, but it's playable and I'm sure you will love it!

My first game I have ever made and my first project I've updated to GitHub

This compiles well with Microsoft Visual C++ 2003. I haven't tested on any newer compiler. 
It uses a 2D game engine called Haaf's Game Engine (HGE), which allows easy code management, and fast rendering.

When playing game, use keys UP-Down-Left-Right to move the map.

It's incomplete, but it's playable and I'm sure you will love it!
